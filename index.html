  <title>Hello World Assignment by Jeff Salazar</title>

  <h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
  <p>This is a hello from Jeff Salazar.  This is my first adventure into web development and I am very excited to be learning new material.  I have not had the expereience others may
  have, however, I am eager to learn what as much as possible.  This assignment was initially frustrating, as I have yet to completely understand the terminology needed to complete this page.
  This project immediately began to make sense for me after discovering the YoutTube video posted for the WATS 1010 assignment.  This content was amazing and made it easy to follow along and 
  fully grasp the meaning of each term and command.  Before finding the video, I was just clicking around and hoping it would begin to make sense.  If I could do it over again, I would have just 
  started from square-one.  It would have gone much faster and I think I would have been less frustrated.  
  
  I'm looking forward to designing more complex code and begin to navigate this world with more fluency.  Thanks for reading.
